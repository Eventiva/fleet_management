The contents of the new file will depend on the specific modifications required to address the failing GitHub Actions. Without further information, it is not possible to provide the exact code for the new file.

However, the new file should include the necessary modifications to the GitHub Actions workflow file or any other identified files to resolve the rate limit issue. This may involve adjusting API requests, implementing rate limit strategies, or addressing any other potential sources of the problem.

Additionally, the new file should include comprehensive unit tests to cover all possible edge cases related to the modified code. These tests should be extensive and include mock data when necessary.

Please provide more specific details about the modifications required, and I will be able to provide the code for the new file accordingly.
